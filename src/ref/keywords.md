# Keywords

This is a list of _keywords_ in C++.  Keywords describe certain constructs of C++, and represent specific ideas understood by the compiler.  These words cannot be used as variable names or function names, as they would be misunderstood as their cooresponding meaning in C++, not as a variable or function.

This list should serve as a reference keywords that you should be aware of, so you don't accidently name a variable or function a keyword.  In addition, it can be used as a quick guide over all the constructs described in C++ that you might use in your programming course.

| Keyword | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `if` | Marks the beginning of a conditional block. |
| `else` | Defines a block that is run only when the preceding `if` condition is false. |
| `using namespace` | Brings all the members of a certain object into scope, such as `std`. |
| `int` | Primitive datatype for integers. |
| `bool` | Primitive datatype for booleans. |
| `char` | Primitive datatype for characters. |
