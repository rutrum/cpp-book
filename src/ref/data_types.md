# Data Types

Every variable has a _data type_ that describes what kind of variable it is.  This is a list of data types you might come across as a beginner in C++.

| Data Type | Description |
| -- | :-- |
| `int` | Integers that range from [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup>) |
| `bool` | Values `true` or `false` |
| `char` | Characters from the [ASCII Table](./ascii_table.md) |
| `float` | Floating point numbers, or decimals |

<!-- ## Integer Types

These types are all integers.  They all very in size and purpose, but `int` is the most common and will typically serve all your needs.

| Data Type | Range | Size |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `int` | [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup>)  | 4 bytes |
| `long` | [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup>) | 8 bytes |
| `long long` | [-2<sup>63</sup>, 2<sup>63</sup>) | 16 bytes |

## Boolean

The boolean is either true or false, where false is represented as a zero value and true is nonzero value.

| Data Type | Size |
| -- | -- | 
| `bool` | 1 byte |

## Character

The character represents a symbol from the ASCII table.  Together they form a larger datatype called a "string".

| Data Type | Size |
| -- | -- | 
| `char` | 1 byte | -->
