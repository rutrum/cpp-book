# Unix Commands

This is a list of commands you might use on Thomas at the command line.  They are called "Unix" commands because Thomas runs on linux which uses these commands across all operated systems.  MacOS is also a Unix based operating system, whereas Windows is not, and has their own special set of commands.

| Command | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `pwd` | Prints the "present working directory", the path of the folder you are currently at. | 
| `ls` | Lists all the files and folders in the current directory. |
| `cd dir/` | Changes the current directory to the specified one. |
| `cd ..` | Move out the current directory into the parent folder. |
| `touch file.txt` | Creates a new file called `file.txt` |
| `mkdir dir/` | Creates a new folder called `dir/` |
| `g++ file.cpp` | Compiles C++ files. Output file is written to `a.out` by default. |
| `a.out` | This isn't necessarily a command, but is the default file created after compiling a C++ file.  Simply typing the name of the file will run it. |
