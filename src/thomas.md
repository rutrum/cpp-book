# Butler's Teaching Cluster: Thomas

Thomas is a supercomputer that sits at Butler.  It is used for teaching programming and allows students and faculty to use it to run large computations. For this course, you will use it to compile and run your C++ programs.

To access Thomas from a school computer, you'll need to do two things:
* Map your network drive to Thomas
* Use Putty to connect to Thomas

## Map Your Network Drive

## Connecting to Thomas

Thomas isn't like your personal computer.  There is no graphical interface like Windows on Thomas.  Instead, it uses a very lightweight Linux OS.  To interact with Thomas, we'll have to use what's called _the command line_.

We'll use a program called Putty to do this.  Open it up and enter the following in the name field: `thomas.butler.edu`.  Then hit login.  It will open up a _terminal_ and prompt you for your password.  Enter your butler username and password and you'll be logged into Thomas under your butler email.  Success!
