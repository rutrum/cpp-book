# Conditionals

In this chapter, we are going to learn about the `if`, `else`, and `else if` blocks and how they _branch_ code.  These allow us to make decisions based on variables.  These allow us to run different lines of code under different conditions.

In addition, we'll learn about the conditions used to make those decisions.  These are evaluated to a new type of variable: a _boolean_.  These are values that are either _true_ or _false_.  You can get booleans by using _comparators_ like less than `<`, greater than `>`, etc.
